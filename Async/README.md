# ‚è± Node.js Code Execution ‚Äì Sync, Async, and Promises

This project demonstrates the three types of code execution in Node.js:

---

## ‚úÖ Synchronous Execution

- Executes code **line by line** in the order written.
- Blocks the execution until each line finishes.

---

## ‚è≥ Asynchronous Execution

- Uses functions like `setTimeout()` that delay execution.
- Code continues running **without waiting** for the delayed task to finish.

---

## üîÅ Promise-Based Execution

- Handles asynchronous code using `.then()` after completion.
- Promises allow better control over delayed or non-blocking code.
- It looks similar to synchronous code but executes **asynchronously**.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

```bash
node filename.js
```
---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- `setTimeout()` is used to create **delays** in code execution.
- **Promises** offer a cleaner and more structured way to handle **asynchronous** operations.
